# About Me

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the College of Management Academic Studies, where I just completed my final year. My journey through tech has been driven by a deep love for solving problems and mathematical thinking, a passion that started as early as high school and continues to guide me today.

## Academic Involvement

One of the most meaningful parts of my academic journey was my involvement in the college's Developer Club. In my second year, I joined as a participant, and in my third year, I returned as a mentor. I led a student team through a successful full-stack project, conducting weekly follow-ups, code reviews, and technical guidance. These experiences helped shape me not just as a developer, but as a teammate, mentor, and leader.

I also served as the student representative for the third-year CS class, supporting others both academically and personally.

## Technical Interests

My technical interests revolve around optimization problems, where I enjoy finding the right algorithms and system architectures to achieve the best possible performance under real-world constraints. I'm also highly interested in data science and excited to explore its many applications.

## Background

Before university, I served in the IDF as a systems instructor for SAP and ERP platforms. While I haven't yet worked in the tech industry, I've spent a great deal of time studying how tech companies operate - from development workflows to team dynamics - and I'm eager to apply that knowledge in a real-world setting.

## Beyond Tech

Outside of tech, I enjoy:
- Hiking
- Training
- Eating great food

Nature gives me space to recharge - both mentally and physically.

Friends often describe me as:
- Caring
- Driven
- Practical
- Funny
- Emotionally intelligent
- A natural teacher

I genuinely love helping others learn - whether through private tutoring or mentoring - and see this as a core part of who I am.

## Looking Forward

Looking ahead, I'm excited to join a tech company where I can contribute, grow, and become part of something meaningful. I don't see work as a stepping stone - I see it as a home. Whether temporary or long-term, I want to make an impact.

My dream is to work on algorithmic challenges or dive deeper into data science - but above all, I'm hungry to learn, and ready to start building.
